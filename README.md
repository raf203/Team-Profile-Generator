## Description:
The Team Profile Generator application is an HTML page generator that presents employee boxes with their respective information. The application developed in node.js is accessed by the terminal where questions that will populate the HTML will be presented. There are three different types of profiles: Manager, Engineer and Intern. with specific questions for each one. After finalizing the list of employees an "index.html" file will be generated inside the "dist" folder that can be opened in any browser and adjusted to different screen sizes.
